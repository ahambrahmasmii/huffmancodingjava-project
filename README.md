# Huffman algorithm visualizer

#### This Repository contains a Visualizer of the Tree of Encoding of Huffman's Algorithm.

This project aims at coding and visualizing Huffman Algorithm to encode strings formed by symbols of a self-created alphabet using Huffman Encoding. It supports compression and decompression of strings (aka, the conversion between the string and the encoded bits).

It also provides a Visualizer to visualize the encoding process, which shows the Tree that represents the encoding scheme. From the root, going left-branch would mean adding a “0” to the encoded string, and going right-branch means adding a “1”. At the leaf positions are the letters from the alphabet. This allows us to infer the encoding scheme of all letters in the alphabet.
